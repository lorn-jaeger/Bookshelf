I have a somewhat large phsyical library that I want to be able to manage digitally. There are a few exisiting options for this including LibraryThing and Calibre. But neither really suit my use case. I want to be able to host that list on my website and have more granular control over how the books are displayed. 

The current plan is to build something that can be self-hosted and supports scanning in covers and ISBNs, fetching book meta-data from Amazon or the Library of Congress, and some nice display options. Some other things that might be nice include reviews, a reading history, and multiple users.
